Small and light script/program used to convert Spotify playlists into YouTube playlists

Package requirements:
1. Spotipy
2. Pytube
3. Google API Python Client
4. Google Auth OAuthLib

Need to create a config.py file with the following info:
1. USER_ID (spotify username)
2. SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID (found on the Spotify web dev dashboard)
3. SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET (also found on the Spotify web dev dashboard, be careful with this)
4. CLIENT_SECRETS JSON (found on Google Cloud API console after creating a project)
